## Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Yiyi (Amy) Cao
### Currently open to resarch or analytical interns in Summer 2025, i.e. data scientist (remotely or on-site).
I bring years of experience as a data-driven analyst, with analytical skills and hands-on experience applying Microsoft Excel, SQL, R and Python. With a diverse education background, my expert focuses on data analytics, data science, and machine learning. I graduated with a Math major for Bachelor's degree from University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, and I completed my Master degree in Applied Analytics at Columbia University, with practical projects solving real-world problems. 

### My Hobbies:
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning, speaking, reading, laughing and sleeping as well. I favor delicious food, outdoor activities and party with friends.

#### Possibly in future, Becoming a self-taught Software Engineer / Full-Stack Web Developer, no idea we'll see.
