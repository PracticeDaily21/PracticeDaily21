## Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Yiyi (Amy) Cao
### Becoming a self-taught Software Engineer / Full-Stack Web Developer
I bring years of experience as a data-driven business analyst, with strong analytical skills and hands-on experience applying Microsoft Excel, SQL, R and Python. Taken 2-year courses in Business (including Marketing/ Accounting/ Economics/ Finance/ International Trade) in Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, I graduated with a Math major from University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. In December 2022, I completed my degree in Applied Analytics (STEM-Computer and Information Science) at Columbia University, with many practical projects solving real-world problems. Now as a Applied Math PhD at SUNY Binghamton University, I am seeking full-time data-oriented jobs and learning to become a better self in a team.

### My Hobbies
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning, speaking, reading, laughing and sleeping as well. I like outdoor activities and sports.

#### OMG so much work to do
